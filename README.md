# React JS

## What is React JS?

React.js is a JavaScript library for building fast, interactive user interfaces, primarily in single-page applications. It uses a component-based architecture, Virtual DOM for efficient updates, and JSX syntax for readable code. Its unidirectional data flow and built-in state management simplify complex UI development and dynamic rendering.

### Key Features:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React encourages the development of reusable and modular components.
- **Virtual DOM**: React creates a virtual representation of the real DOM, which helps optimize and improve rendering performance.
- **Declarative**: React makes it easy to design interactive UIs with declarative code.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: React follows a unidirectional data flow, making it predictable and easier to debug.
- **JSX Syntax**: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript code.

## How to Set Up React JS?

### Prerequisite Apps

Before installing React JS, you need to have the following software installed on your system:
- **Node.js**: React relies on Node.js for package management (NPM/Yarn). You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Code Editor**: A good code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for React development.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Node.js and NPM**
   - Download and install Node.js from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Verify installation:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
2. **Create a New React Application**
   - Open your terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-custom-react-app
     ```
   - This command creates a new React project named `my-custom-react-app`. It installs all necessary dependencies and sets up the project structure.

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd my-custom-react-app
